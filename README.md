This project is made to teach english to rural women so that they can use this skill for getting jobs and can teach others too  
Here we also considered women security by adding some NGOs  
This website consists of 3 sections: Learning, Practice and NGOs

### LEARNING SECTION

In this, we are providing classes in 3 levels: beginner, intermediate and professional.

### **PRACTICE SECTION**

In this, we have included game based learning. Here, they can practice what they have learnt in quizzes and games.

### **NGOs**

In this, we have provided some NGOs and they can also see their nearby NGOs.

It is a team based project made for Azure women hackathon 2022 in which we have cleared the round 1 of submitting the PPT and source code and went to second and last round of this hackathon.
